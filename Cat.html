     <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]

        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It also secretes and perceives pheromones.[</p>

       Easily one of the most recognised and popular breed of cat is the Persian. This breed actually has a very old history where they have been at the centre of civilization since they were first introduced into Europe in the 17th century. Up until the late 19th century the breeding of cats with long hair from Turkey, Afghanistan and Persia were classified as Asiatic cats and were commonly bred together. Today they have been bred to keep their very unique look which is a round head, short face, snub nose, chubby cheeks, rounded ears and big eyes.

       The Maine Coon is a native New England breed that hailed from Maine. They were a very popular farm cat, mouser and most likely a ship cat up until the early 19th century. This breed is very good natured and adapts well too many different lifestyles and personalities. They like people being around them but they aren’t necessarily clingy. The mouser trait has still been passed down for many generations so expect your home to be rodent free.

       Ragdolls are very smart and with enough positive reinforcement can quickly pick up tricks and good habits such as scratching posts. This particular breed is fairly new compared to the other breeds as it was first developed by a breeder in the 1960s. They love people and like what their name suggests they simply collapse in your arms when you pick them up. Even if they are cradled on their back, they love a good cuddle and scratch from anyone. They generally stay on the same level as people rather than being at the highest point in the room.

       #4 Siamese

       The Siamese cat is the pinnacle of sophistication as they look like they are all dressed up for a masquerade ball. If you live in an apartment or house that doesn’t allow for pets good luck trying to hide a Siamese as they are very talkative and opinionated. While they are extremely fond of people, they will definitely tell you what they are thinking in a very loud and raspy tone and expect you to wait on them when the call. They do require attention and play time so if you are on the go all the time this may not be the right breed for you.

       The British shorthair is iconic in pop culture being the breed that was featured as puss in boots from Shrek and the Cheshire Cat of Alice in Wonderland. It is obliviously an English breed and has been the pinnacle of the pedigree since the Victorian era. They are very mellow and easy going making them a wonderful addition to any family. They love some affection but doesn’t whinge non-stop when you don’t give them love for 2 seconds.

       #6 Exotic Shorthair

       The exotic shorthair is similar to the Persian breed but with a different coat. They were first bred in the 1950s by cross breeding Persians with American shorthairs. They were then bred with Burmese and Russian Blue breeds before going back to Persian once they had a short coat. The result was a breed with the same features and personality of the Persian but with an easy to care for coat. Due to their pedigree breeding they do come with a lot of health concerns relating to their face.

       While most cats love to sleep and laze around, the Abyssinian lives life to the max. They climb higher, jump further and play harder than their other brethren. They are a very intelligent breed which makes them both an entertaining and challenging pet to have. Abby Grabby is the nickname given to this breed as they are known for taking anything that grabs their attention. If you do plan on getting an Aby be sure to have a tonne of toys on hand as they love to play!
